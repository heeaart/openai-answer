### What is openai?
OpenAI Baselines is a set of highly optimized, state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms to learn control policies in a variety of environments, including classic video games and robotic simulators. The algorithms are based on the same deep reinforcement learning methods that power the AlphaGo and AlphaStar projects. OpenAI Baselines provide a benchmark for much faster comparison of different algorithms and a common platform for reproducible research.
